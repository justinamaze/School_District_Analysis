# Pycity School Analysis

## Overview of the district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help identify any academic dishonesty from the math and reading  grades from the ninth graders of Thomas High School (THS). I'm be using the students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv for my data. The school board doesn't know the extend of the dishonesty or where to exactly identify  any evidence.  I will be replacing math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NANs while keeping the other high school scores the same. Once I've finished my analysis I'll compare my analysis with the origninal analysis I had to see if there was any discrepancies within the data.
